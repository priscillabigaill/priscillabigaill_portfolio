I’m Priscilla Abigail, a third-year Computer Science student at BINUS International University. I have a strong passion for tech especially in cybersecurity, with experience in programming languages like Python, Java, JavaScript, and SQL, as well as tools such as React, Docker, Burpsuite, and Wireshark. 

# 

Currently, I am focused on learning more about network forensics, and the latest trends in cybersecurity. In my free time, I enjoy exploring new technologies, working on personal projects, and developing my skills.
