I’m Priscilla Abigail, a third-year Computer Science student at BINUS International University. I have a strong passion for tech especially in cybersecurity, with experience in programming languages like Python, Java, JavaScript, and SQL, as well as tools such as React, Docker, Burpsuite, and Wireshark. Currently, I am focused on learning more about network forensics, and the latest trends in cybersecurity.

In my free time, I enjoy exploring new technologies, working on personal projects, and developing my skills. I’m also an active participant in student organizations where I contribute to events, all while fostering a sense of community within my university.
